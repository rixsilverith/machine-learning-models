# Machine learning models

Implementations of several machine learning models and algorithms from scratch in Python using the [NumPy]()
library for efficient numerical computations and [matplotlib]() for data and results visualization.

These implementations are not meant be used in production machine learning systems, but as a way of understanding
the internals and working principles of the algorithms available in well known frameworks such as
[TensorFlow]() and [PyTorch]().
